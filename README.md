# Location Tracker

This is a Nextcloud app which can be used to track the location of a user or 
device. It is based on the [OwnTracks](http://owntracks.org) which provides apps for
 Android and iOS.
 
 ## How to use it
 
 In order to store your location on your Nextcloud you need a OwnTracks app, set
 the mode to `HTTP Private`, add the url `https://<yourNextcloud>/index.php/apps/locationtracker/api/v1/location`
 and enable authentication with your Nextcloud user name and password.
